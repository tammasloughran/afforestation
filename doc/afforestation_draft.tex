\begin{itemize}
    \item Impacts of global scale forestation are still poorly understood as there is wide disagreement between models.
    \item We analyse the results from 8 models of a scenario with high fossil fuel emissions and forest expansion. This scenario demonstrates the ability of only forestation strategies to mitigate climate change under continued increasing CO$_2$ emissions, and includes the potential impacts of increased CO$_2$ concentration and a warming climate on vegetation growth.
    \item Model intercomparison shows that there is likely no impact of forestation on global climate under a high global warming scenario.
    \item A set of single-model initial condition ensemble simulations suggests that there is evidence of some increase in local scale warm extremes in response to afforestation, particularly for decreases in cool days.
    \item This is dominated by the increase in albedo as land cover transitions from grasslands and croplands to darker forests.
    \item Furthermore, we find evidence of shift in the global carbon balance, whereby increased uptake of carbon on the land of ~25 PgC by 2100 and a decrease in the uptake of carbon by the ocean.
    \item This is the first intercomparison of the potentials of forestation in emissions-driven, fully-coupled earth system models, which includes a fully interactive carbon cycle and climate feedbacks.

\section{Introduction}

Forests cover approximately 31\% of the global land surface (cite something from FAO?) and are responsible for the removal of 30\% of total anthropogenic emissions from the atmosphere (\cite{friedlingstein_global_2022}).
Forestation is therefore often thought of as a viable strategy to remove CO$_2$ from the atmosphere and mitigate global warming.
In order to effectively limit global warming to below 2°C consistent with the Paris Agreement, there must be not only a reduction of fossil fuel emissions, but also CO$_2$ removal to offset industrial and agricultural activities that are difficult to decarbonize.
There must also be a shift in the reliance of global diets away from agricultural practices that emit greenhouse gasses into the atmosphere (via e.g. forest clearing or ruminating herbivores).
This shift typically implies widespread abandonment of agricultural lands and an increase in natural vegetation, either as reforestation when degraded forests are restored, or as afforestation of lands that were not previously occupied by forest.

Forestation and deforestation affect he climate in two main ways.
Firstly by biogeochemical effects, i.e. changes to the global carbon cycle and carbon storage pools that impact the radiative absorption of the atmosphere.
And secondly by biogeophysical effects, i.e. changes in the physical properties of the land surface such as albedo and surface fluxes (\cite{bala_combined_2007}).
In general, forestation causes a global cooling biogeochemical effect as carbon is taken from the atmosphere and stored in vegetation and soils.
However, the biogophysical impacts of forestation is more varied, with a cooling effect in the low–mid latitudes via enhanced evapotranspiration and further increased cloud cover reflecting incoming shortwave radiation.
In the mid-high latitudes the biogeophysical impacts are a net warming effect because of the decrease of albedo from dark vegetation relative to the surfaces that are seasonally covered in snow.

There have been a number of previous studies on the potential of forestation to remove CO$_2$ from the atmosphere, each using different methods of quantification.
For example, \cite{lenton_radiative_2009} used a simplified ``back-of-the-envelope" analytical calculation approach to estimate the radiative forcing effect of forestation, finding that it has substantial potential relative to most other geoengineering methods.
They estimate a removal of 73 Pg(C) by forestation can result in a decrease of 0.37 W m$^{-2}$ radiative forcing by 2100.
However, such simplified estimates assume that the land carbon storage is stable on long time scales, the decay of which under a future climate could only be estimated with an earth system model.

More sophisticated modelling studies better represent the complexity of the net effects of biogeophysical and biogeochemical impacts.
For example, \cite{sonntag_reforestation_2016} quantified the CO$_2$ removal potential using and Earth System Model, where a high CO$_2$ emissions scenario is simulated (taken from RCP8.5) in combination with the ``forestation" land-use from a low emissions scenario (taken from RCP4.5).
This previous study used the concentration driven CMIP5 version of the MPI-ESM and the CMIP5 representative concentration pathways.
They find that a decrease in 85 ppm (215 Pg(C)) of atmospheric CO$_2$ concentrations by 2100 from forestation results in a cooling of 0.27 K globally. \footnote{Maybe mention Sonntag et al 2018 here as well? And de hertog et al 2022}

Historically, there has been substantial deforestation in temperate forests of Eurasia and North America and in the last few decades deforestation has been focused on the tropics (\cite{goldewijk_estimating_2001}).
The net effect of deforestation is to cool the climate globally due to an increase in albedo  (\cite{davin_climatic_2010}).
\cite{boysen_global_2020} show a cooling of -0.22$\pm$0.2 $^{\circ}$C among 9 climate models in idealized simulations.
\cite{hong_impacts_2022} also show that under a future deforestation scenario this cooling effect might reduce the incident of hot extremes by 5.5-0.9\%. \footnote{Still not sure which stat from this paper to include here.}
However, the effect of future afforestation mat not necessarily be merely the inverse of the effect of future deforestation.

This study aims to quantify the CO$_2$ removal potential of the forestation strategy using CMIP6 models, both at the global and regional scale.
The CMIP6 experiments present a standard set of experiments to draw on for understanding model uncertainty in the climate mitigation potential of forestation.
In particular, ACCESS-ESM1.5 contributed multiple single model ensembles to these experiments allowing us to examine the climate variability uncertainties from a single model.

\section{Methods}

\subsection{Experiments}

The CMIP6 experimental design specifies a set of standard simulations called the Diagnostic, Evaluation and Characterization of Klima (DECK) \parencite{eyring_overview_2016}, which are typically used as the foundation to study more specific research questions.
The DECK includes a pre-industrial control simulation (\textit{piControl}) with constant greenhouse gas concentration forcings, and a historical (\textit{historical}) simulation with transient historical greenhouse gas concentration forcings.
Furthermore, the DECK specifies corresponding simulations (\textit{esm-piControl} and \textit{esm-hist}) that are run in full ``Earth system model" mode with a fully interactive dynamical carbon cycle and for the historical period, fossil fuel and industrial greenhouse gas emissions forcings.
In order to capture the carbon cycle and dynamics of the entire Earth system in response to forestation, including biogeochemical and biogeophysical feedbacks of the land surface and climate system, we use only the Earth system model simulations from relevant intercomparison projects. These emissions-driven simulations are initialized at 2015 from the end of the \textit{esm-hist} experiment.

The forestation scenario we use is the Land Use Model Intercomparison Project's \textit{esm-ssp585-ssp126Lu}, spanning the years 2015--2100 \parencite{lawrence_land_2016}.
This simulation features the surface fossil fuel related CO$_{2}$ emissions from the SSP5-8.5 scenario, and the land-use change from the SSP1-2.6 scenario \parencite{oneill_scenario_2016}.
The SSP5-8.5 scenario emissions represent a high emissions future pathway that results in a radiative forcing of 8.5 W m$^{-2}$ in 2100.
The SSP1-2.6 scenario land-use change assumes a future of sustainable development \parencite{van_vuuren_energy_2017}.
This means low population growth, low pressures on land-use, environmentally friendly changes in diets and increased agricultural efficiency and yields, resulting in abandonment of agricultural lands.
This allows for the expansion of natural lands and forest cover.
We use this scenario because it represents a plausible future scenario that would provide a lower bound on the survivability of vegetation and CO$_2$ draw-down potential of the land surface under a warmer climate.

The reference simulation we use to compare to \textit{esm-ssp585-ssp126Lu} is the \textit{esm-ssp585} from the Coupled Climate-Carbon Cycle Model Intercomparison Project (C4MIP) \parencite{jones_c4mip_2016}.
This is the emissions-driven Earth system model simulation corresponding to the SSP5-8.5 high greenhouse gas scenario that assumes that development is driven by fossil fuels \parencite{oneill_scenario_2016}.
In general, the land use change in this scenario has less expansion of forested lands than \textit{esm-ssp585-ssp126Lu}, but is a mixture of moderate forestation and deforestation.
The notable difference in land-use change compared the forestation scenario is the deforestation in the central African region (Figure S\ref{fig:ACCESS_land_cover}).
By taking the difference between the forestation simulation and the \textit{esm-ssp585} simulation (Equation \ref{equ:diff}), we can examine the impact of forestation on the climate and the carbon cycle.

\begin{equation}
    X|_{for} = X|_{esm-ssp585-ssp126Lu} - X|_{esm-ssp585}
    \label{equ:diff}
\end{equation}

The land-use change dataset used in all CMIP6 experiments is the Land-use Harmonization dataset version 2 (LUH2; \cite{hurtt_harmonization_2020}).
There are only a few areas where there is deforestation in the \textit{esm-ssp585-ssp126Lu} experiment.
These occur in deciduous broad leaf forests in eastern USA, China and western Russia (Figure \ref{fig:land_use_map}).

\subsection{Participating models}

There are seven Earth system models that participated in both LUMIP and C4MIP with simulations available for \textit{esm-ssp585-ssp126Lu} and \textit{esm-ssp585}.
A brief overview of these models are presented in Table \ref{tab:models}.
2 models included wildfire schemes, 3 models included dynamical vegetation, and 6 models included nitrogen nutrient limitaiton.
ACCESS-ESM1-5 is the only model to include phosphorus limitation.
Furthermore, ACCESS-ESM1-5 is the only model to have multiple ensemble members available for both simulations, of which there are 10 for each experiment.

\subsection{Regional analysis}

Regional analyses have been divided into 8 regions that feature large changes in tree cover.
These regions are shown in Figure \ref{fig:box_regions}.
The temperature and precipitation values over the ocean are masked out to represent land only changes in these variables.
The largest differences in tree cover between the two simulations occurs in various hot spots around the globe.
To examine the local scale impact of large changes in tree cover on temperature and precipitation, histograms of the frequency distributions for specific grid-points are calculated, shown by the dots in Figure \ref{fig:box_regions}.
Here, we focus only on ACCESS-ESM, since it is the only model that contributed 10 ensemble members, and thus the statistics of the distribution are most robust for this model.

    \centering
    \includegraphics{../plots/regional_analysis_map.png}
    \caption{Box regions for regional analysis. Dots indicate grid-points that feature large transitions to forest cover and are used in the analysis of the temperature distributions in each simulation.}
    \label{fig:box_regions}
\end{figure}

\subsection{Statistical methods}

We calculate trends in the difference of global mean temperatures and precipitation to examine the change in temperature as forests expand.
For this we use the Theil–Sen slope estimator and test its significance at the 5\% level using the Mann-Kendall trend test.

We also calculate probability histograms to examine the distribution of daily temperatures for the ACCESS-ESM1-5.
The difference in the temperature distribution in the two simulations in response to forestation is tested using 2-sample Kolmogorov-Smirnov test for the equality of distributions at the 5\% level.

To examine the relationship of forestation on climate, correlations were done on ensemble mean surface air temperature and tree fraction using the Spearman rank correlation and the significance was tested at the 5\% level \parencite{kokoska2000crc}.

\section{Results and discussion}

\subsection{Global Multi-model Inter-comparison}

\subsubsection{Carbon cycle}

Each model has a unique internal representation of woody tree biomes and pre-industrial potential vegetation.
It folows that each model interprets the allocation of natural lands from LUH2 to model-specific plant functional types (PFTs) differently.
Combined with differences in grid resolution, this results in a variety of changes in global tree cover for each model (see Figure \ref{fig:land_use_map}).
UKESM1-0-LL, CanESM5 and MPI-ESM1-2-LR include vegetation dynamics that respond to changes in climate, and these are the models that deviate from the LUH2 forcing the most.
CanESM5 in particular stands out as having a net loss of tree area by the end of the century.
MPI-ESM features substantial Amazonian dieback, but large amounts of forest increases in semi-arid regions in Africa and Australia.

ACCES-ESM1-5 is an example that closely follows the spatial distribution of the LUH2 land-use forcing.
By the end of the century, ACCESS-ESM1-5 has a forest expansion of 1.59 million km² and agricultural abandonment of 1.11 million km².
By mid-century, crops reach a minimum of 2.74 million km² less than in 2015, before rising again in the latter half of the century (Figure \ref{fig:land_use_map}).
Forestation is dominated by growth of evergreen broad leaf forests, followed by evergreen needle leaf forests, then deciduous broad leaf forests.
Deciduous needle leaf forests only make a small fraction of forests and do not show any expansion.

    \label{fig:models_cpools}
\end{figure}

CanESM5 has differing ensemble methods for \textit{esm-ssp585} and \textit{esm-ssp585-ssp126Lu}.
One former uses r1i1p1f1 and the latter uses r1i1p2f1.
Therefore, there is some additional perturbation applied to one of those experiments.
The CanESM5 model (green line in \ref{fig:models_cpools}) has been bias corrected by subtracting the difference in the carbon pools between the reference and forestation simulations at the start of the experiment (2015).
This brings CanESM in line with other models for total land carbon.
CanESM has net deforestation by the end of the century, but increases in cVeg in the middle half of the century, which are transferred to the litter and soil carbon pools by the end of the century.
It also has no significant change in global temperature by the end of the century.

ACCESS-ESM and UKESM are roughly in the middle of the model spread.
These models share the same atmospheric model component and therefore share many of the same climate physics, however UKESM has a greater transient climate response to forestation and atmospheric CO$_2$ changes.

For vegetation related pools (cLand and cVeg) models tend to diminish in productivity by the end of the century.
The models  either maintain a draw-down potential of ~20-30PgC by 2100, or the gains from the middle of the century have been lost by the end of the century.
Soil carbon shows varied response to forestation. ACCESS and UKESM show decreases in soil carbon, while other models show increases.

\subsubsection{Regional/local changes in vegetation and extremes}

\begin{itemize}
    \item There is an increase in vegetation carbon of about 25 Pg C by the end of the century.
    \item The increased CO$_2$ draw-down from the combined effect of forestation and CO$_2$ fertilization seems to be offset by the increase in respiration in the litter and soil by the end of the century.
    \item cSoil is lower than SSP585 by about 4 Pg carbon.

\begin{itemize}
    \item The \textit{esm-ssp585-ssp126Lu} land use has both forestation and deforestation.
    \item Increases in cVeg for all regions except Boreal North America, where some ensemble members show decreases in cVeg by the end of the century.
    \item Decreases in cSoil for Australia, Amazonia, Eastern North America. Western Eurasia, East Asia, Boreal Eurasia, Boreal North America, generally also show decreases in cSoil but there are a few ensemble members that show increases by the end of the century.

\begin{itemize}
    \item The lack of climate warming mitigation potential in the forestation scenario may be due to redistribution of the global carbon budget into the natural sinks. An increase in vegetation uptake would lead to a decrease in atmospheric CO$_2$ accumulation, which would result in a reduction of partial CO$_2$ pressure on the ocean and hence lead to a reduction of CO$_2$ in the ocean sink.
    \item The LUH2 data set severely underestimates the tree cover that is originally dictated by IMAGE (the integrated assessment model that produces the SSP1-2.6 scenario).
    \item The bio-geophysical impacts of growing trees causes localized warming at the extreme ends of the temperature distribution, especial in the higher latitudes where trees tend to be slow growing and the bare ground either has a high albedo or is covered in snow. This warming might offset the climate mitigation potential of forestation.

\section{Conclusion}

\begin{itemize}
    \item Models show no significant impact of forestation on global climate under a high emissions and high global warming scenario. Of the two models that do show significant impact of foretation on global temperature, they disgree on sign.
    \item Evidence in a shift in the global carbon balance; increased uptake of carbon on the land of ~25 PgC by 2100 and a decrease in the uptake of carbon by the ocean.
    \item Evidence of some increase in local scale warm extremes. Gridpoints that have strong forestationshow decreases in number of cool days and increase in number of extreme hot days. Suggests dominance of the effect of increased albedo from forestation in ACCESS-ESM1-5.
   \item For forestation to be viable as a carbon dioxide strategy it must also exist in conjunction with other strategies.
   \item Forestation also provide aditional benefits such as increased habitat, biodiversity and decreased runoff and soil erosion (features that are not modeled by Earth system models).
\end{itemize}

While it is clear that most models show that growing trees under a warmer (and sometimes drier) climate is not an effective climate mitigation strategy, this does not mean that forestation should not be done.
None of the models in this study account for the potential of forests to be used for other carbon dioxide removal strategies such as for bioenergy with carbon capture and storage.
If forests are sustainably harvested and regrown, then the removal of CO$_2$ from the atmosphere accumulates over time, and while vegetation may be lost in individual natural disturbance events such as fires, the historically removed carbon remains locked.
Forestation increases the natural land-based carbon, which opens the way for other forest management strategies to remove carbon dioxide.
Forest management may also provide the potential to grow trees that have a higher albedo
