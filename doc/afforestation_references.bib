	abstract = {Abstract. By coordinating the design and distribution of global climate model simulations of the past, current, and future climate, the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project (CMIP) has become one of the foundational elements of climate science. However, the need to address an ever-expanding range of scientific questions arising from more and more research communities has made it necessary to revise the organization of CMIP. After a long and wide community consultation, a new and more federated structure has been put in place. It consists of three major elements: (1) a handful of common experiments, the DECK (Diagnostic, Evaluation and Characterization of Klima) and CMIP historical simulations (1850–near present) that will maintain continuity and help document basic characteristics of models across different phases of CMIP; (2) common standards, coordination, infrastructure, and documentation that will facilitate the distribution of model outputs and the characterization of the model ensemble; and (3) an ensemble of CMIP-Endorsed Model Intercomparison Projects (MIPs) that will be specific to a particular phase of CMIP (now CMIP6) and that will build on the DECK and CMIP historical simulations to address a large range of specific questions and fill the scientific gaps of the previous CMIP phases. The DECK and CMIP historical simulations, together with the use of CMIP data standards, will be the entry cards for models participating in CMIP. Participation in CMIP6-Endorsed MIPs by individual modelling groups will be at their own discretion and will depend on their scientific interests and priorities. With the Grand Science Challenges of the World Climate Research Programme (WCRP) as its scientific backdrop, CMIP6 will address three broad questions:  – How does the Earth system respond to forcing? – What are the origins and consequences of systematic model biases?  – How can we assess future climate changes given internal climate variability, predictability, and uncertainties in scenarios? This CMIP6 overview paper presents the background and rationale for the new structure of CMIP, provides a detailed description of the DECK and CMIP6 historical simulations, and includes a brief introduction to the 21 CMIP6-Endorsed MIPs.},

	abstract = {Abstract. Human land-use activities have resulted in large changes to the Earth's surface, with resulting implications for climate. In the future, land-use activities are likely to expand and intensify further to meet growing demands for food, fiber, and energy. The Land Use Model Intercomparison Project (LUMIP) aims to further advance understanding of the impacts of land-use and land-cover change (LULCC) on climate, specifically addressing the following questions. (1) What are the effects of LULCC on climate and biogeochemical cycling (past–future)? (2) What are the impacts of land management on surface fluxes of carbon, water, and energy, and are there regional land-management strategies with the promise to help mitigate climate change? In addressing these questions, LUMIP will also address a range of more detailed science questions to get at process-level attribution, uncertainty, data requirements, and other related issues in more depth and sophistication than possible in a multi-model context to date. There will be particular focus on the separation and quantification of the effects on climate from LULCC relative to all forcings, separation of biogeochemical from biogeophysical effects of land use, the unique impacts of land-cover change vs. land-management change, modulation of land-use impact on climate by land–atmosphere coupling strength, and the extent to which impacts of enhanced CO2 concentrations on plant photosynthesis are modulated by past and future land use.LUMIP involves three major sets of science activities: (1) development of an updated and expanded historical and future land-use data set, (2) an experimental protocol for specific LUMIP experiments for CMIP6, and (3) definition of metrics and diagnostic protocols that quantify model performance, and related sensitivities, with respect to LULCC. In this paper, we describe LUMIP activity (2), i.e., the LUMIP simulations that will formally be part of CMIP6. These experiments are explicitly designed to be complementary to simulations requested in the CMIP6 DECK and historical simulations and other CMIP6 MIPs including ScenarioMIP, C4MIP, LS3MIP, and DAMIP. LUMIP includes a two-phase experimental design. Phase one features idealized coupled and land-only model simulations designed to advance process-level understanding of LULCC impacts on climate, as well as to quantify model sensitivity to potential land-cover and land-use change. Phase two experiments focus on quantification of the historic impact of land use and the potential for future land management decisions to aid in mitigation of climate change. This paper documents these simulations in detail, explains their rationale, outlines plans for analysis, and describes a new subgrid land-use tile data request for selected variables (reporting model output data separately for primary and secondary land, crops, pasture, and urban land-use types). It is essential that modeling groups participating in LUMIP adhere to the experimental design as closely as possible and clearly report how the model experiments were executed.},

	abstract = {The improvements and validation of several parameterization schemes in the second version of the Beijing Climate Center Atmosphere–Vegetation Interaction Model (BCC\_AVIM2.0) are introduced in this study. The main updates include a replacement of the water-only lake module by the common land model lake module (CoLM-lake) with a more realistic snow–ice–water–soil framework, a parameterization scheme for rice paddies added in the vegetation module, renewed parameterizations of snow cover fraction and snow surface albedo to accommodate the varied snow aging effect during different stages of a snow season, a revised parameterization to calculate the threshold temperature to initiate freeze (thaw) of soil water (ice) rather than being fixed at 0°C in BCC\_AVIM1.0, a prognostic phenology scheme for vegetation growth instead of empirically prescribed dates for leaf onset/fall, and a renewed scheme to depict solar radiation transfer through the vegetation canopy. The above updates have been implemented in BCC\_AVIM2.0 to serve as the land component of the BCC Climate System Model (BCC\_CSM). Preliminary results of BCC\_AVIM in the ongoing Land Surface, Snow, and Soil Moisture Model Intercomparison Project (LS3MIP) of the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project Phase 6 (CMIP6) show that the overall performance of BCC\_AVIM2.0 is better than that of BCC\_AVIM1.0 in the simulation of surface energy budgets at the seasonal timescale. Comparing the simulations of annual global land average before and after the updates in BCC\_AVIM2.0 reveals that the bias of net surface radiation is reduced from −12.0 to −11.7 W m−2 and the root mean square error (RMSE) is reduced from 20.6 to 19.0 W m−2; the bias and RMSE of latent heat flux are reduced from 2.3 to −0.1 W m−2 and from 15.4 to 14.3 W m−2, respectively; the bias of sensible heat flux is increased from 2.5 to 5.1 W m−2 but the RMSE is reduced from 18.4 to 17.0 W m−2.},

Thereby, we isolate the land use change eﬀects of the RCPs from those of other anthropogenic forcings. We ﬁnd that by 2100 atmospheric CO2 is reduced by 85 ppm in the reforestation model experiment compared to the reference RCP8.5 model experiment. This reduction is higher than previous estimates and is due to increased forest cover in combination with climate and CO2 feedbacks. We ﬁnd that reforestation leads to global annual mean temperatures being lower by 0.27 K in 2100. We ﬁnd large annual mean warming reductions in sparsely populated areas, whereas reductions in temperature extremes are also large in densely populated areas.},

	abstract = {To contribute to a quantitative comparison of climate engineering (CE) methods, we assess atmosphere-, ocean-, and land-based CE measures with respect to Earth system eﬀects consistently within one comprehensive model. We use the Max Planck Institute Earth System Model (MPI-ESM) with prognostic carbon cycle to compare solar radiation management (SRM) by stratospheric sulfur injection and two carbon dioxide removal methods: aﬀorestation and ocean alkalinization. The CE model experiments are designed to oﬀset the eﬀect of fossil-fuel burning on global mean surface air temperature under the RCP8.5 scenario to follow or get closer to the RCP4.5 scenario. Our results show the importance of feedbacks in the CE eﬀects. For example, as a response to SRM the land carbon uptake is enhanced by 92 Gt by the year 2100 compared to the reference RCP8.5 scenario due to reduced soil respiration thus reducing atmospheric CO2. Furthermore, we show that normalizations allow for a better comparability of diﬀerent CE methods. For example, we ﬁnd that due to compensating processes such as biogeophysical eﬀects of aﬀorestation more carbon needs to be removed from the atmosphere by aﬀorestation than by alkalinization to reach the same global warming reduction. Overall, we illustrate how diﬀerent CE methods aﬀect the components of the Earth system; we identify challenges arising in a CE comparison, and thereby contribute to developing a framework for a comparative assessment of CE.},

	abstract = {The Canadian Earth System Model version 5 (CanESM5) is a global model developed to simulate historical climate change and variability, to make centennialscale projections of future climate, and to produce initialized seasonal and decadal predictions. This paper describes the model components and their coupling, as well as various aspects of model development, including tuning, optimization, and a reproducibility strategy. We also document the stability of the model using a long control simulation, quantify the model’s ability to reproduce large-scale features of the historical climate, and evaluate the response of the model to external forcing. CanESM5 is comprised of three-dimensional atmosphere (T63 spectral resolution equivalent roughly to 2.8◦) and ocean (nominally 1◦) general circulation models, a sea-ice model, a land surface scheme, and explicit land and ocean carbon cycle models. The model features relatively coarse resolution and high throughput, which facilitates the production of large ensembles. CanESM5 has a notably higher equilibrium climate sensitivity (5.6 K) than its predecessor, CanESM2 (3.7 K), which we brieﬂy discuss, along with simulated changes over the historical period. CanESM5 simulations contribute to the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project phase 6 (CMIP6) and will be employed for climate science and service applications in Canada.},

	abstract = {Abstract. Projections of future climate change play a fundamental role in improving understanding of the climate system as well as characterizing societal risks and response options. The Scenario Model Intercomparison Project (ScenarioMIP) is the primary activity within Phase 6 of the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project (CMIP6) that will provide multi-model climate projections based on alternative scenarios of future emissions and land use changes produced with integrated assessment models. In this paper, we describe ScenarioMIP's objectives, experimental design, and its relation to other activities within CMIP6. The ScenarioMIP design is one component of a larger scenario process that aims to facilitate a wide range of integrated studies across the climate science, integrated assessment modeling, and impacts, adaptation, and vulnerability communities, and will form an important part of the evidence base in the forthcoming Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) assessments. At the same time, it will provide the basis for investigating a number of targeted science and policy questions that are especially relevant to scenario-based analysis, including the role of specific forcings such as land use and aerosols, the effect of a peak and decline in forcing, the consequences of scenarios that limit warming to below 2 °C, the relative contributions to uncertainty from scenarios, climate models, and internal variability, and long-term climate system outcomes beyond the 21st century. To serve this wide range of scientific communities and address these questions, a design has been identified consisting of eight alternative 21st century scenarios plus one large initial condition ensemble and a set of long-term extensions, divided into two tiers defined by relative priority. Some of these scenarios will also provide a basis for variants planned to be run in other CMIP6-Endorsed MIPs to investigate questions related to specific forcings. Harmonized, spatially explicit emissions and land use scenarios generated with integrated assessment models will be provided to participating climate modeling groups by late 2016, with the climate model simulations run within the 2017–2018 time frame, and output from the climate model projections made available and analyses performed over the 2018–2020 period.},

The current version, ACCESS-ESM1.5, has been mainly developed to enable Australia to participate in the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project Phase 6 (CMIP6) with an ESM version. Here we describe the model components and changes to the previous version, ACCESSESM1. We use the 500-year pre-industrial control run to highlight the stability of the physical climate and the carbon cycle. The long spin-up, negligible drift in temperature and small pre-industrial net carbon fluxes (0.02 and 0.08 PgC yearÀ1 for land and ocean respectively) highlight the suitability of ACCESS-ESM1.5 to explore modes of variability in the climate system and coupling to the carbon cycle. The physical climate and carbon cycle for the present day have been evaluated using the CMIP6 historical simulation by comparing against observations and ACCESS-ESM1. Although there is generally little change in the climate simulation from the earlier model, many aspects of the carbon simulation are improved. An assessment of the climate response to CO2 forcing indicates that ACCESS-ESM1.5 has an equilibrium climate sensitivity of 3.878C.},

	abstract = {We document the development of the first version of the U.K. Earth System Model UKESM1. The model represents a major advance on its predecessor HadGEM2-ES, with enhancements to all component models and new feedback mechanisms. These include a new core physical model with a well-resolved stratosphere; terrestrial biogeochemistry with coupled carbon and nitrogen cycles and enhanced land management; tropospheric-stratospheric chemistry allowing the holistic simulation of radiative forcing from ozone, methane, and nitrous oxide; two-moment, five-species, modal aerosol; and ocean biogeochemistry with two-way coupling to the carbon cycle and atmospheric aerosols. The complexity of coupling between the ocean, land, and atmosphere physical climate and biogeochemical cycles in UKESM1 is unprecedented for an Earth system model. We describe in detail the process by which the coupled model was developed and tuned to achieve acceptable performance in key physical and Earth system quantities and discuss the challenges involved in mitigating biases in a model with complex connections between its components. Overall, the model performs well, with a stable pre-industrial state and good agreement with observations in the latter period of its historical simulations. However, global mean surface temperature exhibits stronger-than-observed cooling from 1950 to 1970, followed by rapid warming from 1980 to 2014. Metrics from idealized simulations show a high climate sensitivity relative to previous generations of models: Equilibrium climate sensitivity is 5.4 K, transient climate response ranges from 2.68 to 2.85 K, and transient climate response to cumulative emissions is 2.49 to 2.66 K TtC−1.},

	abstract = {Abstract. This article describes the new Earth system model (ESM), the Model for
Interdisciplinary Research on Climate, Earth System version 2 for Long-term
simulations (MIROC-ES2L), using a state-of-the-art climate model as the
physical core. This model embeds a terrestrial biogeochemical component with
explicit carbon–nitrogen interaction to account for soil nutrient control
on plant growth and the land carbon sink. The model's ocean biogeochemical
component is largely updated to simulate the biogeochemical cycles of carbon,
nitrogen, phosphorus, iron, and oxygen such that oceanic primary
productivity can be controlled by multiple nutrient limitations. The ocean
nitrogen cycle is coupled with the land component via river discharge
processes, and external inputs of iron from pyrogenic and lithogenic sources
are considered. Comparison of a historical simulation with observation
studies showed that the model could reproduce the transient global climate
change and carbon cycle as well as the observed large-scale spatial patterns
of the land carbon cycle and upper-ocean biogeochemistry. The model
demonstrated historical human perturbation of the nitrogen cycle through
land use and agriculture and simulated the resultant impact on the
terrestrial carbon cycle. Sensitivity analyses under preindustrial
conditions revealed that the simulated ocean biogeochemistry could be
altered regionally (and substantially) by nutrient input from the atmosphere
and rivers. Based on an idealized experiment in which CO2 was
prescribed to increase at a rate of 1 \% yr−1, the transient climate
response (TCR) is estimated to be 1.5 K, i.e., approximately 70 \% of that from
our previous ESM used in the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project Phase 5
(CMIP5). The cumulative airborne fraction (AF) is also reduced by 15 \%
because of the intensified land carbon sink, which results in an airborne
fraction close to the multimodel mean of the CMIP5 ESMs. The transient
climate response to cumulative carbon emissions (TCRE) is 1.3 K EgC−1,
i.e., slightly smaller than the average of the CMIP5 ESMs, which suggests
that “optimistic” future climate projections will be made by the model.
This model and the simulation results contribute to CMIP6. The MIROC-ES2L
could further improve our understanding of climate–biogeochemical
interaction mechanisms, projections of future environmental changes, and
exploration of our future options regarding sustainable development by
evolving the processes of climate, biogeochemistry, and human activities in
a holistic and interactive manner.},

	abstract = {The second version of the fully coupled Norwegian Earth System Model (NorESM2) is presented and evaluated. NorESM2 is based on the second version of the Community Earth System Model (CESM2), but has entirely different ocean and ocean biogeochemistry models; a new module for aerosols in the atmosphere model along with aerosol-radiation-cloud interactions and changes related to the moist energy formulation, deep convection scheme and angular momentum conserva5 tion; modiﬁed albedo and air-sea turbulent ﬂux calculations; and minor changes to land and sea ice models. We show results from low (∼2◦) and medium (∼1◦) atmosphere-land resolution versions of NorESM2 that have both been used to carry out simulations for the sixth phase of the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project (CMIP6). The stability of the pre-industrial climate and the sensitivity of the model to abrupt and gradual quadrupling of CO2 is assessed, along with the ability of the model to simulate the historical climate under the CMIP6 forcings. As compared to observations and reanalyses, NorESM2 10 represents an improvement over previous versions of NorESM in most aspects. NorESM2 is less sensitive to greenhouse gas forcing than its predecessors, with an equilibrium climate sensitivity of 2.5 K in both resolutions on a 150 year frame. We also consider the model response to future scenarios as deﬁned by selected shared socioeconomic pathways (SSPs) from the Scenario Model Intercomparison Project deﬁned under CMIP6. Under the four scenarios SSP1-2.6, SSP2-4.5, SSP3-7.0, and SSP5-8.5, the warming in the period 2090–2099 compared to 1850–1879 reaches 1.3, 2.2, 3.0, and 3.9 K in NorESM2-LM, 15 and 1.3, 2.1, 3.1, and 3.9 K in NorESM–MM, robustly similar in both resolutions. NorESM2-LM shows a rather satisfactorily evolution of recent sea ice area. In NorESM2-LM an ice free Arctic Ocean is only avoided in the SSP1-2.6 scenario.},

	abstract = {Abstract. Human land use activities have resulted in large
changes to the biogeochemical and biophysical properties of the Earth's
surface, with consequences for climate and other ecosystem services. In the
future, land use activities are likely to expand and/or intensify further to
meet growing demands for food, fiber, and energy. As part of the World
Climate Research Program Coupled Model Intercomparison Project (CMIP6), the
international community has developed the next generation of advanced Earth
system models (ESMs) to estimate the combined effects of human activities
(e.g., land use and fossil fuel emissions) on the carbon–climate system. A
new set of historical data based on the History of the Global Environment
database (HYDE), and multiple alternative scenarios of the future
(2015–2100) from Integrated Assessment Model (IAM) teams, is required as
input for these models. With most ESM simulations for CMIP6 now completed,
it is important to document the land use patterns used by those
simulations. Here we present results from the Land-Use Harmonization 2
(LUH2) project, which smoothly connects updated historical reconstructions
of land use with eight new future projections in the format required for
ESMs. The harmonization strategy estimates the fractional land use patterns,
underlying land use transitions, key agricultural management information,
and resulting secondary lands annually, while minimizing the differences
between the end of the historical reconstruction and IAM initial conditions
and preserving changes depicted by the IAMs in the future. The new approach
builds on a similar effort from CMIP5 and is now provided at higher
resolution (0.25∘×0.25∘) over a longer time domain (850–2100, with
extensions to 2300) with more detail (including multiple crop and pasture
types and associated management practices) using more input datasets
(including Landsat remote sensing data) and updated algorithms (wood harvest
and shifting cultivation); it is assessed via a new diagnostic package. The
new LUH2 products contain {\textgreater} 50 times the information content of
the datasets used in CMIP5 and are designed to enable new and improved
estimates of the combined effects of land use on the global carbon–climate
system.},

	abstract = {Accurate assessment of anthropogenic carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions and their redistribution among the atmosphere, ocean, and terrestrial biosphere in a changing climate is critical to better understand the global carbon cycle, support the development of climate policies, and project future climate change. Here we describe and synthesize datasets and methodology to quantify the ﬁve major components of the global carbon budget and their uncertainties. Fossil CO2 emissions (EFOS) are based on energy statistics and cement production data, while emissions from land-use change (ELUC), mainly deforestation, are based on land use and land-use change data and bookkeeping models. Atmospheric CO2 concentration is measured directly, and its growth rate (GATM) is computed from the annual changes in concentration. The ocean CO2 sink (SOCEAN) is estimated with global ocean biogeochemistry models and observation-based data products. The terrestrial CO2 sink (SLAND) is estimated with dynamic global vegetation models. The resulting carbon budget imbalance (BIM), the difference between the estimated total emissions and the estimated changes in the atmosphere, ocean, and terrestrial biosphere, is a measure of imperfect data and understanding of the contemporary carbon cycle. All uncertainties are reported as ±1σ . For the ﬁrst time, an approach is shown to reconcile the difference in our ELUC estimate with the one from national greenhouse gas inventories, supporting the assessment of collective countries’ climate progress.},
