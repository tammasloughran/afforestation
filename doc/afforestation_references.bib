	abstract = {Abstract. By coordinating the design and distribution of global climate model simulations of the past, current, and future climate, the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project (CMIP) has become one of the foundational elements of climate science. However, the need to address an ever-expanding range of scientific questions arising from more and more research communities has made it necessary to revise the organization of CMIP. After a long and wide community consultation, a new and more federated structure has been put in place. It consists of three major elements: (1) a handful of common experiments, the DECK (Diagnostic, Evaluation and Characterization of Klima) and CMIP historical simulations (1850–near present) that will maintain continuity and help document basic characteristics of models across different phases of CMIP; (2) common standards, coordination, infrastructure, and documentation that will facilitate the distribution of model outputs and the characterization of the model ensemble; and (3) an ensemble of CMIP-Endorsed Model Intercomparison Projects (MIPs) that will be specific to a particular phase of CMIP (now CMIP6) and that will build on the DECK and CMIP historical simulations to address a large range of specific questions and fill the scientific gaps of the previous CMIP phases. The DECK and CMIP historical simulations, together with the use of CMIP data standards, will be the entry cards for models participating in CMIP. Participation in CMIP6-Endorsed MIPs by individual modelling groups will be at their own discretion and will depend on their scientific interests and priorities. With the Grand Science Challenges of the World Climate Research Programme (WCRP) as its scientific backdrop, CMIP6 will address three broad questions:  – How does the Earth system respond to forcing? – What are the origins and consequences of systematic model biases?  – How can we assess future climate changes given internal climate variability, predictability, and uncertainties in scenarios? This CMIP6 overview paper presents the background and rationale for the new structure of CMIP, provides a detailed description of the DECK and CMIP6 historical simulations, and includes a brief introduction to the 21 CMIP6-Endorsed MIPs.},

	abstract = {Abstract. Human land-use activities have resulted in large changes to the Earth's surface, with resulting implications for climate. In the future, land-use activities are likely to expand and intensify further to meet growing demands for food, fiber, and energy. The Land Use Model Intercomparison Project (LUMIP) aims to further advance understanding of the impacts of land-use and land-cover change (LULCC) on climate, specifically addressing the following questions. (1) What are the effects of LULCC on climate and biogeochemical cycling (past–future)? (2) What are the impacts of land management on surface fluxes of carbon, water, and energy, and are there regional land-management strategies with the promise to help mitigate climate change? In addressing these questions, LUMIP will also address a range of more detailed science questions to get at process-level attribution, uncertainty, data requirements, and other related issues in more depth and sophistication than possible in a multi-model context to date. There will be particular focus on the separation and quantification of the effects on climate from LULCC relative to all forcings, separation of biogeochemical from biogeophysical effects of land use, the unique impacts of land-cover change vs. land-management change, modulation of land-use impact on climate by land–atmosphere coupling strength, and the extent to which impacts of enhanced CO2 concentrations on plant photosynthesis are modulated by past and future land use.LUMIP involves three major sets of science activities: (1) development of an updated and expanded historical and future land-use data set, (2) an experimental protocol for specific LUMIP experiments for CMIP6, and (3) definition of metrics and diagnostic protocols that quantify model performance, and related sensitivities, with respect to LULCC. In this paper, we describe LUMIP activity (2), i.e., the LUMIP simulations that will formally be part of CMIP6. These experiments are explicitly designed to be complementary to simulations requested in the CMIP6 DECK and historical simulations and other CMIP6 MIPs including ScenarioMIP, C4MIP, LS3MIP, and DAMIP. LUMIP includes a two-phase experimental design. Phase one features idealized coupled and land-only model simulations designed to advance process-level understanding of LULCC impacts on climate, as well as to quantify model sensitivity to potential land-cover and land-use change. Phase two experiments focus on quantification of the historic impact of land use and the potential for future land management decisions to aid in mitigation of climate change. This paper documents these simulations in detail, explains their rationale, outlines plans for analysis, and describes a new subgrid land-use tile data request for selected variables (reporting model output data separately for primary and secondary land, crops, pasture, and urban land-use types). It is essential that modeling groups participating in LUMIP adhere to the experimental design as closely as possible and clearly report how the model experiments were executed.},

	abstract = {The improvements and validation of several parameterization schemes in the second version of the Beijing Climate Center Atmosphere–Vegetation Interaction Model (BCC\_AVIM2.0) are introduced in this study. The main updates include a replacement of the water-only lake module by the common land model lake module (CoLM-lake) with a more realistic snow–ice–water–soil framework, a parameterization scheme for rice paddies added in the vegetation module, renewed parameterizations of snow cover fraction and snow surface albedo to accommodate the varied snow aging effect during different stages of a snow season, a revised parameterization to calculate the threshold temperature to initiate freeze (thaw) of soil water (ice) rather than being fixed at 0°C in BCC\_AVIM1.0, a prognostic phenology scheme for vegetation growth instead of empirically prescribed dates for leaf onset/fall, and a renewed scheme to depict solar radiation transfer through the vegetation canopy. The above updates have been implemented in BCC\_AVIM2.0 to serve as the land component of the BCC Climate System Model (BCC\_CSM). Preliminary results of BCC\_AVIM in the ongoing Land Surface, Snow, and Soil Moisture Model Intercomparison Project (LS3MIP) of the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project Phase 6 (CMIP6) show that the overall performance of BCC\_AVIM2.0 is better than that of BCC\_AVIM1.0 in the simulation of surface energy budgets at the seasonal timescale. Comparing the simulations of annual global land average before and after the updates in BCC\_AVIM2.0 reveals that the bias of net surface radiation is reduced from −12.0 to −11.7 W m−2 and the root mean square error (RMSE) is reduced from 20.6 to 19.0 W m−2; the bias and RMSE of latent heat flux are reduced from 2.3 to −0.1 W m−2 and from 15.4 to 14.3 W m−2, respectively; the bias of sensible heat flux is increased from 2.5 to 5.1 W m−2 but the RMSE is reduced from 18.4 to 17.0 W m−2.},

Thereby, we isolate the land use change eﬀects of the RCPs from those of other anthropogenic forcings. We ﬁnd that by 2100 atmospheric CO2 is reduced by 85 ppm in the reforestation model experiment compared to the reference RCP8.5 model experiment. This reduction is higher than previous estimates and is due to increased forest cover in combination with climate and CO2 feedbacks. We ﬁnd that reforestation leads to global annual mean temperatures being lower by 0.27 K in 2100. We ﬁnd large annual mean warming reductions in sparsely populated areas, whereas reductions in temperature extremes are also large in densely populated areas.},

	abstract = {To contribute to a quantitative comparison of climate engineering (CE) methods, we assess atmosphere-, ocean-, and land-based CE measures with respect to Earth system eﬀects consistently within one comprehensive model. We use the Max Planck Institute Earth System Model (MPI-ESM) with prognostic carbon cycle to compare solar radiation management (SRM) by stratospheric sulfur injection and two carbon dioxide removal methods: aﬀorestation and ocean alkalinization. The CE model experiments are designed to oﬀset the eﬀect of fossil-fuel burning on global mean surface air temperature under the RCP8.5 scenario to follow or get closer to the RCP4.5 scenario. Our results show the importance of feedbacks in the CE eﬀects. For example, as a response to SRM the land carbon uptake is enhanced by 92 Gt by the year 2100 compared to the reference RCP8.5 scenario due to reduced soil respiration thus reducing atmospheric CO2. Furthermore, we show that normalizations allow for a better comparability of diﬀerent CE methods. For example, we ﬁnd that due to compensating processes such as biogeophysical eﬀects of aﬀorestation more carbon needs to be removed from the atmosphere by aﬀorestation than by alkalinization to reach the same global warming reduction. Overall, we illustrate how diﬀerent CE methods aﬀect the components of the Earth system; we identify challenges arising in a CE comparison, and thereby contribute to developing a framework for a comparative assessment of CE.},

	abstract = {The Canadian Earth System Model version 5 (CanESM5) is a global model developed to simulate historical climate change and variability, to make centennialscale projections of future climate, and to produce initialized seasonal and decadal predictions. This paper describes the model components and their coupling, as well as various aspects of model development, including tuning, optimization, and a reproducibility strategy. We also document the stability of the model using a long control simulation, quantify the model’s ability to reproduce large-scale features of the historical climate, and evaluate the response of the model to external forcing. CanESM5 is comprised of three-dimensional atmosphere (T63 spectral resolution equivalent roughly to 2.8◦) and ocean (nominally 1◦) general circulation models, a sea-ice model, a land surface scheme, and explicit land and ocean carbon cycle models. The model features relatively coarse resolution and high throughput, which facilitates the production of large ensembles. CanESM5 has a notably higher equilibrium climate sensitivity (5.6 K) than its predecessor, CanESM2 (3.7 K), which we brieﬂy discuss, along with simulated changes over the historical period. CanESM5 simulations contribute to the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project phase 6 (CMIP6) and will be employed for climate science and service applications in Canada.},

	abstract = {Abstract. Projections of future climate change play a fundamental role in improving understanding of the climate system as well as characterizing societal risks and response options. The Scenario Model Intercomparison Project (ScenarioMIP) is the primary activity within Phase 6 of the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project (CMIP6) that will provide multi-model climate projections based on alternative scenarios of future emissions and land use changes produced with integrated assessment models. In this paper, we describe ScenarioMIP's objectives, experimental design, and its relation to other activities within CMIP6. The ScenarioMIP design is one component of a larger scenario process that aims to facilitate a wide range of integrated studies across the climate science, integrated assessment modeling, and impacts, adaptation, and vulnerability communities, and will form an important part of the evidence base in the forthcoming Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) assessments. At the same time, it will provide the basis for investigating a number of targeted science and policy questions that are especially relevant to scenario-based analysis, including the role of specific forcings such as land use and aerosols, the effect of a peak and decline in forcing, the consequences of scenarios that limit warming to below 2 °C, the relative contributions to uncertainty from scenarios, climate models, and internal variability, and long-term climate system outcomes beyond the 21st century. To serve this wide range of scientific communities and address these questions, a design has been identified consisting of eight alternative 21st century scenarios plus one large initial condition ensemble and a set of long-term extensions, divided into two tiers defined by relative priority. Some of these scenarios will also provide a basis for variants planned to be run in other CMIP6-Endorsed MIPs to investigate questions related to specific forcings. Harmonized, spatially explicit emissions and land use scenarios generated with integrated assessment models will be provided to participating climate modeling groups by late 2016, with the climate model simulations run within the 2017–2018 time frame, and output from the climate model projections made available and analyses performed over the 2018–2020 period.},

The current version, ACCESS-ESM1.5, has been mainly developed to enable Australia to participate in the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project Phase 6 (CMIP6) with an ESM version. Here we describe the model components and changes to the previous version, ACCESSESM1. We use the 500-year pre-industrial control run to highlight the stability of the physical climate and the carbon cycle. The long spin-up, negligible drift in temperature and small pre-industrial net carbon fluxes (0.02 and 0.08 PgC yearÀ1 for land and ocean respectively) highlight the suitability of ACCESS-ESM1.5 to explore modes of variability in the climate system and coupling to the carbon cycle. The physical climate and carbon cycle for the present day have been evaluated using the CMIP6 historical simulation by comparing against observations and ACCESS-ESM1. Although there is generally little change in the climate simulation from the earlier model, many aspects of the carbon simulation are improved. An assessment of the climate response to CO2 forcing indicates that ACCESS-ESM1.5 has an equilibrium climate sensitivity of 3.878C.},

	abstract = {We document the development of the first version of the U.K. Earth System Model UKESM1. The model represents a major advance on its predecessor HadGEM2-ES, with enhancements to all component models and new feedback mechanisms. These include a new core physical model with a well-resolved stratosphere; terrestrial biogeochemistry with coupled carbon and nitrogen cycles and enhanced land management; tropospheric-stratospheric chemistry allowing the holistic simulation of radiative forcing from ozone, methane, and nitrous oxide; two-moment, five-species, modal aerosol; and ocean biogeochemistry with two-way coupling to the carbon cycle and atmospheric aerosols. The complexity of coupling between the ocean, land, and atmosphere physical climate and biogeochemical cycles in UKESM1 is unprecedented for an Earth system model. We describe in detail the process by which the coupled model was developed and tuned to achieve acceptable performance in key physical and Earth system quantities and discuss the challenges involved in mitigating biases in a model with complex connections between its components. Overall, the model performs well, with a stable pre-industrial state and good agreement with observations in the latter period of its historical simulations. However, global mean surface temperature exhibits stronger-than-observed cooling from 1950 to 1970, followed by rapid warming from 1980 to 2014. Metrics from idealized simulations show a high climate sensitivity relative to previous generations of models: Equilibrium climate sensitivity is 5.4 K, transient climate response ranges from 2.68 to 2.85 K, and transient climate response to cumulative emissions is 2.49 to 2.66 K TtC−1.},

	abstract = {Abstract. This article describes the new Earth system model (ESM), the Model for
Interdisciplinary Research on Climate, Earth System version 2 for Long-term
simulations (MIROC-ES2L), using a state-of-the-art climate model as the
physical core. This model embeds a terrestrial biogeochemical component with
explicit carbon–nitrogen interaction to account for soil nutrient control
on plant growth and the land carbon sink. The model's ocean biogeochemical
component is largely updated to simulate the biogeochemical cycles of carbon,
nitrogen, phosphorus, iron, and oxygen such that oceanic primary
productivity can be controlled by multiple nutrient limitations. The ocean
nitrogen cycle is coupled with the land component via river discharge
processes, and external inputs of iron from pyrogenic and lithogenic sources
are considered. Comparison of a historical simulation with observation
studies showed that the model could reproduce the transient global climate
change and carbon cycle as well as the observed large-scale spatial patterns
of the land carbon cycle and upper-ocean biogeochemistry. The model
demonstrated historical human perturbation of the nitrogen cycle through
land use and agriculture and simulated the resultant impact on the
terrestrial carbon cycle. Sensitivity analyses under preindustrial
conditions revealed that the simulated ocean biogeochemistry could be
altered regionally (and substantially) by nutrient input from the atmosphere
and rivers. Based on an idealized experiment in which CO2 was
prescribed to increase at a rate of 1 \% yr−1, the transient climate
response (TCR) is estimated to be 1.5 K, i.e., approximately 70 \% of that from
our previous ESM used in the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project Phase 5
(CMIP5). The cumulative airborne fraction (AF) is also reduced by 15 \%
because of the intensified land carbon sink, which results in an airborne
fraction close to the multimodel mean of the CMIP5 ESMs. The transient
climate response to cumulative carbon emissions (TCRE) is 1.3 K EgC−1,
i.e., slightly smaller than the average of the CMIP5 ESMs, which suggests
that “optimistic” future climate projections will be made by the model.
This model and the simulation results contribute to CMIP6. The MIROC-ES2L
could further improve our understanding of climate–biogeochemical
interaction mechanisms, projections of future environmental changes, and
exploration of our future options regarding sustainable development by
evolving the processes of climate, biogeochemistry, and human activities in
a holistic and interactive manner.},

	abstract = {The second version of the fully coupled Norwegian Earth System Model (NorESM2) is presented and evaluated. NorESM2 is based on the second version of the Community Earth System Model (CESM2), but has entirely different ocean and ocean biogeochemistry models; a new module for aerosols in the atmosphere model along with aerosol-radiation-cloud interactions and changes related to the moist energy formulation, deep convection scheme and angular momentum conserva5 tion; modiﬁed albedo and air-sea turbulent ﬂux calculations; and minor changes to land and sea ice models. We show results from low (∼2◦) and medium (∼1◦) atmosphere-land resolution versions of NorESM2 that have both been used to carry out simulations for the sixth phase of the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project (CMIP6). The stability of the pre-industrial climate and the sensitivity of the model to abrupt and gradual quadrupling of CO2 is assessed, along with the ability of the model to simulate the historical climate under the CMIP6 forcings. As compared to observations and reanalyses, NorESM2 10 represents an improvement over previous versions of NorESM in most aspects. NorESM2 is less sensitive to greenhouse gas forcing than its predecessors, with an equilibrium climate sensitivity of 2.5 K in both resolutions on a 150 year frame. We also consider the model response to future scenarios as deﬁned by selected shared socioeconomic pathways (SSPs) from the Scenario Model Intercomparison Project deﬁned under CMIP6. Under the four scenarios SSP1-2.6, SSP2-4.5, SSP3-7.0, and SSP5-8.5, the warming in the period 2090–2099 compared to 1850–1879 reaches 1.3, 2.2, 3.0, and 3.9 K in NorESM2-LM, 15 and 1.3, 2.1, 3.1, and 3.9 K in NorESM–MM, robustly similar in both resolutions. NorESM2-LM shows a rather satisfactorily evolution of recent sea ice area. In NorESM2-LM an ice free Arctic Ocean is only avoided in the SSP1-2.6 scenario.},

	abstract = {Abstract. Human land use activities have resulted in large
changes to the biogeochemical and biophysical properties of the Earth's
surface, with consequences for climate and other ecosystem services. In the
future, land use activities are likely to expand and/or intensify further to
meet growing demands for food, fiber, and energy. As part of the World
Climate Research Program Coupled Model Intercomparison Project (CMIP6), the
international community has developed the next generation of advanced Earth
system models (ESMs) to estimate the combined effects of human activities
(e.g., land use and fossil fuel emissions) on the carbon–climate system. A
new set of historical data based on the History of the Global Environment
database (HYDE), and multiple alternative scenarios of the future
(2015–2100) from Integrated Assessment Model (IAM) teams, is required as
input for these models. With most ESM simulations for CMIP6 now completed,
it is important to document the land use patterns used by those
simulations. Here we present results from the Land-Use Harmonization 2
(LUH2) project, which smoothly connects updated historical reconstructions
of land use with eight new future projections in the format required for
ESMs. The harmonization strategy estimates the fractional land use patterns,
underlying land use transitions, key agricultural management information,
and resulting secondary lands annually, while minimizing the differences
between the end of the historical reconstruction and IAM initial conditions
and preserving changes depicted by the IAMs in the future. The new approach
builds on a similar effort from CMIP5 and is now provided at higher
resolution (0.25∘×0.25∘) over a longer time domain (850–2100, with
extensions to 2300) with more detail (including multiple crop and pasture
types and associated management practices) using more input datasets
(including Landsat remote sensing data) and updated algorithms (wood harvest
and shifting cultivation); it is assessed via a new diagnostic package. The
new LUH2 products contain {\textgreater} 50 times the information content of
the datasets used in CMIP5 and are designed to enable new and improved
estimates of the combined effects of land use on the global carbon–climate
system.},

	abstract = {Accurate assessment of anthropogenic carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions and their redistribution among the atmosphere, ocean, and terrestrial biosphere in a changing climate is critical to better understand the global carbon cycle, support the development of climate policies, and project future climate change. Here we describe and synthesize datasets and methodology to quantify the ﬁve major components of the global carbon budget and their uncertainties. Fossil CO2 emissions (EFOS) are based on energy statistics and cement production data, while emissions from land-use change (ELUC), mainly deforestation, are based on land use and land-use change data and bookkeeping models. Atmospheric CO2 concentration is measured directly, and its growth rate (GATM) is computed from the annual changes in concentration. The ocean CO2 sink (SOCEAN) is estimated with global ocean biogeochemistry models and observation-based data products. The terrestrial CO2 sink (SLAND) is estimated with dynamic global vegetation models. The resulting carbon budget imbalance (BIM), the difference between the estimated total emissions and the estimated changes in the atmosphere, ocean, and terrestrial biosphere, is a measure of imperfect data and understanding of the contemporary carbon cycle. All uncertainties are reported as ±1σ . For the ﬁrst time, an approach is shown to reconcile the difference in our ELUC estimate with the one from national greenhouse gas inventories, supporting the assessment of collective countries’ climate progress.},

However, biophysical effects of deforestation, which include changes in land surface albedo, evapotranspiration, and cloud cover also affect climate. Here we present results from several large-scale deforestation experiments performed with a three-dimensional coupled global carbon-cycle and climate model. These simulations were performed by using a fully three-dimensional model representing physical and biogeochemical interactions among land, atmosphere, and ocean. We find that global-scale deforestation has a net cooling influence on Earth's climate, because the warming carbon-cycle effects of deforestation are overwhelmed by the net cooling associated with changes in albedo and evapotranspiration. Latitude-specific deforestation experiments indicate that afforestation projects in the tropics would be clearly beneficial in mitigating global-scale warming, but would be counterproductive if implemented at high latitudes and would offer only marginal benefits in temperate regions. Although these results question the efficacy of mid- and high-latitude afforestation projects for climate mitigation, forests remain environmentally valuable resources for many reasons unrelated to climate.},

The net biogeophysical impact of deforestation results from the competition between these effects. Globally, the albedo effect is dominant because of its wider-scale impact, and the net biogeophysical impact of deforestation is thus a cooling of 21 K. Over land, the balance between the different processes varies with latitude. In temperate and boreal zones of the Northern Hemisphere the albedo effect is stronger and deforestation thus induces a cooling. Conversely, in the tropics the net impact of deforestation is a warming, because evapotranspiration efﬁciency and surface roughness provide the dominant inﬂuence. The authors also explore the importance of the ocean coupling in shaping the climate response to deforestation. First, the temperature over ocean responds to the land cover perturbation. Second, even the temperature change over land is greatly affected by the ocean coupling. By assuming ﬁxed oceanic conditions, the net effect of deforestation, averaged over all land areas, is a warming, whereas taking into account the coupling with the ocean leads, on the contrary, to a net land cooling. Furthermore, it is shown that the main parameter involved in the coupling with the ocean is surface albedo. Indeed, a change in albedo modiﬁes temperature and humidity in the whole troposphere, thus enabling the initially land-conﬁned perturbation to be transferred to the ocean. Finally, the radiative forcing framework is discussed in the context of land cover change impact on climate. The experiments herein illustrate that deforestation triggers two opposite types of forcing mechanisms—radiative forcing (owing to surface albedo change) and nonradiative forcing (owing to change in evapotranspiration efﬁciency and surface roughness)—that exhibit a similar magnitude globally. However, when applying the radiative forcing concept, nonradiative processes are ignored, which may lead to a misrepresentation of land cover change impact on climate.},

	abstract = {Abstract. Changes in forest cover have a strong effect on climate through the alteration of surface biogeophysical and biogeochemical properties that affect energy, water and carbon exchange with the atmosphere. To quantify biogeophysical and biogeochemical effects of deforestation in a consistent setup, nine Earth system models (ESMs) carried out an idealized experiment in the framework of the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project, phase 6 (CMIP6). Starting from their pre-industrial state, models linearly replace 20×106 km2 of forest area in densely forested regions with grasslands over a period of 50 years followed by a stabilization period of 30 years. Most of the deforested area is in the tropics, with a secondary peak in the boreal region. The effect on global annual near-surface temperature ranges from no significant change to a cooling by 0.55 ∘C, with a multi-model mean of -0.22±0.21 ∘C. Five models simulate a temperature increase over deforested land in the tropics and a cooling over deforested boreal land. In these models, the latitude at which the temperature response changes sign ranges from 11 to 43∘ N, with a multi-model mean of 23∘ N. A multi-ensemble analysis reveals that the detection of near-surface temperature changes even under such a strong deforestation scenario may take decades and thus longer than current policy horizons. The observed changes emerge first in the centre of deforestation in tropical regions and propagate edges, indicating the influence of non-local effects. The biogeochemical effect of deforestation are land carbon losses of 259±80 PgC that emerge already within the first decade. Based on the transient climate response to cumulative emissions (TCRE) this would yield a warming by 0.46 ± 0.22 ∘C, suggesting a net warming effect of deforestation. Lastly, this study introduces the “forest sensitivity” (as a measure of climate or carbon change per fraction or area of deforestation), which has the potential to provide lookup tables for deforestation–climate emulators in the absence of strong non-local climate feedbacks. While there is general agreement across models in their response to deforestation in terms of change in global temperatures and land carbon pools, the underlying changes in energy and carbon fluxes diverge substantially across models and geographical regions. Future analyses of the global deforestation experiments could further explore the effect on changes in seasonality of the climate response as well as large-scale circulation changes to advance our understanding and quantification of deforestation effects in the ESM frameworks.},

The impacts of LULCC on historical and future climate have been largely investigated, mostly using simulations with or without land use change. However, it is still not clear to what extent the projections of future climate change depend on the choice of land use scenario, which can provide important guidance on using land use and land management as a tool for regional climate mitigation. Here, using ten Earth system models participating in future land use policy sensitivity experiments in Land Use Model Intercomparison Project (LUMIP), we assessed the impact of two different land use scenarios (SSP1-2.6 and SSP3-7.0) on extreme climate. The results demonstrate that the use of different land use change scenarios has a substantial effect on the projections of regional climate extreme changes. Our study also reveals that, compared with other anthropogenic forcings, land use change has a considerable contribution to regional temperature extreme changes, with the contribution ranging from −14.0\% to 10.3\%, and the contribution to regional precipitation extreme change is larger, with a range of −118.4{\textasciitilde}138.8\%. The global climate effects of land use change are smaller in magnitude than regional effects, with a small (5\%) contribution to temperature extreme change. We also found a large spread in the model’s responses to LULCC, especially for precipitation extremes, suggesting that observation-based studies on reducing models’ uncertainties are needed to obtain more robust future projections of regional climate change. Our study highlights the essential role of land use and land management strategies in future regional climate mitigation.},

	abstract = {Land cover and land management change (LCLMC) has been highlighted for its critical role in mitigation scenarios, both in terms of global mitigation and local adaptation. Yet, the climate effect of individual LCLMC options, their dependence on the background climate and the local vs. non-local responses are still poorly understood across different Earth System Models (ESMs). Here we simulate the climatic effects of LCLMC using three state-of-the-art ESMs, including the Community 5 Earth System Model (CESM), the Max Planck Institute for Meteorology Earth System Model (MPI-ESM) and the European Consortium Earth System Model (EC-EARTH). We assess the LCLMC effects using four idealized experiments: (i) a fully afforested world, (ii) a world fully covered by cropland, (ii) a fully afforested world with extensive wood harvesting, and (iv) a full cropland world with extensive irrigation. In these idealized sensitivity experiments, performed under present-day climate conditions, the effects of the different LCLMC strategies represent an upper bound for the potential of global mitigation and 10 local adaptation. To disentangle the local and non-local effects from the LCLMC, a checkerboard-like LCLMC perturbation, i.e., alternating grid boxes with and without LCLMC, is applied. The local effects of deforestation on surface temperature are largely consistent across the ESMs and the observations, with a cooling in boreal latitudes and a warming in the tropics. However, the energy balance components driving the change in surface temperature show less consistency across the ESMs and the observations. Additionally, some biases exist in speciﬁc ESMs, such as a strong albedo response in CESM mid-latitudes and a 15 soil thawing driven warming in boreal latitudes in EC-EARTH. The non-local effects on surface temperature are broadly consistent across ESMs for afforestation, though larger model uncertainty exists for cropland expansion. Irrigation clearly induces a cooling effect, however; the ESMs disagree whether these are mainly local or non-local effects. Wood harvesting is found to have no discernible biogeophysical effects on climate. Our results overall underline the potential of ensemble simulations to inform decision making regarding future climate consequences of land-based mitigation and adaptation strategies.},

Here, we analyse how carbon dioxide removal methods are integrated into 41 of the 50 Long-term Low Emission Development Strategies submitted to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC), before 2022. We show that enhancing forest and soil carbon sinks are the most advocated strategies but are only explicitly quantified in 12. Residual emissions by 2050 are only quantified in 20 strategies and most of them use forests to achieve national net-zero targets. Strategies that quantify both residual emissions and carbon dioxide removal identify national constraints, such as wildfire risks to forests and limited geological CO

	abstract = {Reasons for the large uncertainty in land use and land cover change (LULCC) emissions go beyond recognized issues related to the available data on land cover change and the fact that model simulations rely on a simpliﬁed and incomplete description of the complexity of biological and LULCC processes. The large range across published LULCC emission estimates is also fundamentally driven by the fact that the net LULCC ﬂux is deﬁned and calculated in different ways across models. We introduce a conceptual framework that allows us to compare the different types of models and simulation setups used to derive land use ﬂuxes. We ﬁnd that published studies are based on at least nine different definitions of the net LULCC ﬂux. Many multi-model syntheses lack a clear agreement on deﬁnition. Our analysis reveals three key processes that are accounted for in different ways: the land use feedback, the loss of additional sink capacity, and legacy (regrowth and decomposition) ﬂuxes. We show that these terminological differences, alone, explain differences between published net LULCC ﬂux estimates that are of the same order as the published estimates themselves. This has consequences for quantiﬁcations of the residual terrestrial sink: the spread in estimates caused by terminological differences is conveyed to those of the residual sink. Furthermore, the application of inconsistent deﬁnitions of net LULCC ﬂux and residual sink has led to double-counting of ﬂuxes in the past. While the decision to use a speciﬁc definition of the net LULCC ﬂux will depend on the scientiﬁc application and potential political considerations, our analysis shows that the uncertainty of the net LULCC ﬂux can be substantially reduced when the existing terminological confusion is resolved.},

	abstract = {Abstract. Quantifying the net carbon flux from land use and land cover changes (fLULCC) is critical for understanding the global carbon cycle and, hence, to support climate change mitigation. However, large-scale fLULCC is not directly measurable and has to be inferred from models instead, such as semi-empirical bookkeeping models and process-based dynamic global vegetation models (DGVMs). By definition, fLULCC estimates are not directly comparable between these two different model types. As an important example, DGVM-based fLULCC in the annual global carbon budgets is estimated under transient environmental forcing and includes the so-called loss of additional sink capacity (LASC). The LASC results from the impact of environmental changes on land carbon storage potential of managed land compared to potential vegetation and accumulates over time, which is not captured in bookkeeping models. The fLULCC from transient DGVM simulations, thus, strongly depends on the timing of land use and land cover changes mainly because LASC accumulation is cut off at the end of the simulated period. To estimate the LASC, the fLULCC from pre-industrial DGVM simulations, which is independent of changing environmental conditions, can be used. Additionally, DGVMs using constant present-day environmental forcing enable an approximation of bookkeeping estimates. Here, we analyse these three DGVM-derived fLULCC estimations (under transient, pre-industrial, and present-day forcing) for 12 models within 18 regions and quantify their differences as well as climate- and CO2-induced components and compare them to bookkeeping estimates. Averaged across the models, we find a global fLULCC (under transient conditions) of 2.0±0.6 PgC yr−1 for 2009–2018, of which ∼40 \% are attributable to the LASC (0.8±0.3 PgC yr−1). From 1850 onward, the fLULCC accumulated to 189±56 PgC with 40±15 PgC from the LASC. Around 1960, the accumulating nature of the LASC causes global transient fLULCC estimates to exceed estimates under present-day conditions, despite generally increased carbon stocks in the latter. Regional hotspots of high cumulative and annual LASC values are found in the USA, China, Brazil, equatorial Africa, and Southeast Asia, mainly due to deforestation for cropland. Distinct negative LASC estimates in Europe (early reforestation) and from 2000 onward in the Ukraine (recultivation of post-Soviet abandoned agricultural land), indicate that fLULCC estimates in these regions are lower in transient DGVM compared to bookkeeping approaches. Our study unravels the strong dependence of fLULCC estimates on the time a certain land use and land cover change event happened to occur and on the chosen time period for the forcing of environmental conditions in the underlying simulations. We argue for an approach that provides an accounting of the fLULCC that is more robust against these choices, for example by estimating a mean DGVM ensemble fLULCC and LASC for a defined reference period and homogeneous environmental changes (CO2 only).},

In addition, an evaluation of a pair of CESM2 long preindustrial control and historical ensemble simulations is presented. These simulations were performed using the nominal 1° horizontal resolution conﬁguration of the coupled model with both the “low‐top” (40 km, with limited chemistry) and “high‐top” (130 km, with comprehensive chemistry) versions of the atmospheric component. CESM2 contains many substantial science and infrastructure improvements and new capabilities since its previous major release, CESM1, resulting in improved historical simulations in comparison to CESM1 and available observations. These include major reductions in low‐latitude precipitation and shortwave cloud forcing biases; better representation of the Madden‐Julian Oscillation; better El Niño‐Southern Oscillation‐related teleconnections; and a global land carbon accumulation trend that agrees well with observationally based estimates. Most tropospheric and surface features of the low‐ and high‐top simulations are very similar to each other, so these improvements are present in both conﬁgurations. CESM2 has an equilibrium climate sensitivity of 5.1–5.3 °C, larger than in CESM1, primarily due to a combination of relatively small changes to cloud microphysics and boundary layer parameters. In contrast, CESM2's transient climate response of 1.9–2.0 °C is comparable to that of CESM1. The model outputs from these and many other simulations are available to the research community, and they represent CESM2's contributions to the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project Phase 6.},

Here we make simple but robust calculations of the maximum impact of such changes.

The projected range of CO2 concentrations in 2100, under a range of emissions scenarios developed for the IPCC, is 170±600 ppm above 2000 levels. This range is mostly due to different assumptions regarding fossil fuel emissions. If all of the carbon so far released by land-use changes could be restored to the terrestrial biosphere, atmospheric CO2 concentration at the end of the century would be about 40±70 ppm less than it would be if no such intervention had occurred. Conversely, complete global deforestation over the same time frame would increase atmospheric concentrations by about 130±290 ppm. These are extreme assumptions; the maximum feasible reforestation and afforestation activities over the next 50 years would result in a reduction in CO2 concentration of about 15±30 ppm by the end of the century. Thus the time course of fossil fuel emissions will be the major factor in determining atmospheric CO2 concentrations for the foreseeable future.},

	abstract = {Significance Most nations recently agreed to hold global average temperature rise to well below 2 °C. We examine how much climate mitigation nature can contribute to this goal with a comprehensive analysis of “natural climate solutions” (NCS): 20 conservation, restoration, and/or improved land management actions that increase carbon storage and/or avoid greenhouse gas emissions across global forests, wetlands, grasslands, and agricultural lands. We show that NCS can provide over one-third of the cost-effective climate mitigation needed between now and 2030 to stabilize warming to below 2 °C. Alongside aggressive fossil fuel emissions reductions, NCS offer a powerful set of options for nations to deliver on the Paris Climate Agreement while improving soil productivity, cleaning our air and water, and maintaining biodiversity., Better stewardship of land is needed to achieve the Paris Climate Agreement goal of holding warming to below 2 °C; however, confusion persists about the specific set of land stewardship options available and their mitigation potential. To address this, we identify and quantify “natural climate solutions” (NCS): 20 conservation, restoration, and improved land management actions that increase carbon storage and/or avoid greenhouse gas emissions across global forests, wetlands, grasslands, and agricultural lands. We find that the maximum potential of NCS—when constrained by food security, fiber security, and biodiversity conservation—is 23.8 petagrams of CO2 equivalent (PgCO2e) y−1 (95\% CI 20.3–37.4). This is ≥30\% higher than prior estimates, which did not include the full range of options and safeguards considered here. About half of this maximum (11.3 PgCO2e y−1) represents cost-effective climate mitigation, assuming the social cost of CO2 pollution is ≥100 USD MgCO2e−1 by 2030. Natural climate solutions can provide 37\% of cost-effective CO2 mitigation needed through 2030 for a >66\% chance of holding warming to below 2 °C. One-third of this cost-effective NCS mitigation can be delivered at or below 10 USD MgCO2−1. Most NCS actions—if effectively implemented—also offer water filtration, flood buffering, soil health, biodiversity habitat, and enhanced climate resilience. Work remains to better constrain uncertainty of NCS mitigation estimates. Nevertheless, existing knowledge reported here provides a robust basis for immediate global action to improve ecosystem stewardship as a major solution to climate change.},

Recent studies suggest that the biogeophysical effects are dominated by changing roughness, and it remains unclear whether this can be reconciled with earlier modeling studies that highlighted the importance of a reduction of evapotranspiration in the low latitudes and a reduction of net shortwave radiation at the surface in the high latitudes. To clarify this situation, we analyze the local effects of deforestation on surface energy balance and temperature in the MPI-ESM climate model by performing three separate experiments: switching from forest to grass all surface properties, only surface albedo, and only surface roughness. We find that the locally induced changes in surface temperature are dominated by changes in surface roughness for the annual mean, the response of the diurnal amplitude, and the seasonal response to deforestation. For these three quantities, the results of the MPI-ESM lie within the range of observation-based data sets. Deforestation-induced decreases in surface roughness contribute substantially to winter cooling in the boreal regions and to decreases in evapotranspiration in the tropics. By comparing the energy balance decompositions from the three experiments, the view that roughness changes dominate the biogeophysical consequences of deforestation can be reconciled with the earlier studies highlighting the relevance of evapotranspiration.},

Observations indicate that local effects induce a warming in most locations, while many climate models show a global mean cooling when simulating global deforestation. We show that a nonlocal cooling in models, which is excluded from observations, may strongly contribute to these conflicting results. For the MPI-ESM, the globally averaged nonlocal cooling exceeds the globally averaged local warming by a factor of three, for global deforestation but also for realistic areal extents and spatial distributions of deforestation. Furthermore, the globally averaged nonlocal effects dominate the local effects in realistic scenarios across a range of climate models. We conclude that observations alone are not sufficient to capture the full biogeophysical effects, and climate models are needed to better understand and quantify the full effects of deforestation before they are considered in strategies for climate mitigation.},

	abstract = {When quantifying temperature changes induced by deforestation (e.g., cooling in high latitudes, warming in low latitudes), satellite data, in situ observations, and climate models differ concerning the height at which the temperature is typically measured/simulated. In this study the effects of deforestation on surface temperature, near-surface air temperature, and lower atmospheric temperature are compared by analyzing the biogeophysical temperature effects of large-scale deforestation in the Max Planck Institute Earth System Model (MPI-ESM) separately for local effects (which are only apparent at the location of deforestation) and nonlocal effects (which are also apparent elsewhere). While the nonlocal effects (cooling in most regions) inﬂuence the temperature of the surface and lowest atmospheric layer equally, the local effects (warming in the tropics but a cooling in the higher latitudes) mainly affect the temperature of the surface. In agreement with observation-based studies, the local effects on surface and near-surface air temperature respond differently in the MPI-ESM, both concerning the magnitude of local temperature changes and the latitude at which the local deforestation effects turn from a cooling to a warming (at 45–55◦ N for surface temperature and around 35◦ N for near-surface air temperature). Subsequently, our single-model results are compared to model data from multiple climate models from the Climate Model Intercomparison Project (CMIP5). This inter-model comparison shows that in the northern midlatitudes, both concerning the summer warming and winter cooling, near-surface air temperature is affected by the local effects only about half as strongly as surface temperature. This study shows that the choice of temperature variable has a considerable effect on the observed and simulated temperature change. Studies about the biogeophysical effects of deforestation must carefully choose which temperature to consider.},

	abstract = {It's not only the carbon in the trees Forest loss affects climate not just because of the impacts it has on the carbon cycle, but also because of how it affects the fluxes of energy and water between the land and the atmosphere. Evaluating global impact is complicated because deforestation can produce different results in different climate zones, making it hard to determine large-scale trends rather than more local ones. Alkama and Cescatti conducted a global assessment of the biophysical effects of forest cover change. Forest loss amplifies diurnal temperature variations, increases mean and maximum air temperatures, and causes a significant amount of warming when compared to CO 2 emission from land-use change. Science , this issue p. 600 , The biophysical effects of recent global forest cover change have caused measurable warming. , Changes in forest cover affect the local climate by modulating the land-atmosphere fluxes of energy and water. The magnitude of this biophysical effect is still debated in the scientific community and currently ignored in climate treaties. Here we present an observation-driven assessment of the climate impacts of recent forest losses and gains, based on Earth observations of global forest cover and land surface temperatures. Our results show that forest losses amplify the diurnal temperature variation and increase the mean and maximum air temperature, with the largest signal in arid zones, followed by temperate, tropical, and boreal zones. In the decade 2003–2012, variations of forest cover generated a mean biophysical warming on land corresponding to about 18\% of the global biogeochemical signal due to CO 2 emission from land-use change.},

	abstract = {Land-use change is one of the focal processes in Earth system models because it has strong impacts on terrestrial biogeophysical and biogeochemical conditions. However, modeling land-use impacts is still challenging because of model complexity and uncertainty. This study examined the results of simulations of land-use change impacts by the Model for Interdisciplinary Research on Climate, Earth System version 2 for long-term simulations (MIROC-ES2L) conducted under the Land-Use Model Intercomparison Project protocol. In a historical experiment, the model reproduced biogeophysical impacts such as decreasing trends in land-surface net radiation and evapotranspiration by about 1970. Among biogeochemical impacts, the model captured the global decrease of vegetation and soil carbon stocks caused by extensive deforestation. By releasing ecosystem carbon stock to the atmosphere, land-use change shortened the mean residence time of terrestrial carbon and accelerated its turnover rate, especially in low latitudes. Future projections based on Shared Socioeconomic Pathways indicated substantial alteration of land conditions caused primarily by climatic change and secondarily by land-use change. Sensitivity experiments conducted by exchanging land-use data between different future projection baseline experiments showed that, at the global scale, the anticipated extent of land-use conversion would likely play a modest role in the future terrestrial radiation, water, and carbon budgets. Regional investigations revealed that future land use would exert a considerable influence on runoff and vegetation carbon stock. Further model refinement is required to improve its capability to analyze its complicated terrestrial linkages or nexus (e.g., food, bioenergy, and carbon sequestration) to climate-change impacts.},

	abstract = {Abstract. Climate projections depend on scenarios of fossil fuel emissions and land use change, and the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) AR5 parallel process assumes consistent climate scenarios across integrated assessment and earth system models (IAMs and ESMs). The CMIP5 (Coupled Model Intercomparison Project Phase 5) project used a novel "land use harmonization" based on the Global Land use Model (GLM) to provide ESMs with consistent 1500–2100 land use trajectories generated by historical data and four IAMs. A direct coupling of the Global Change Assessment Model (GCAM), GLM, and the Community ESM (CESM) has allowed us to characterize and partially address a major gap in the CMIP5 land coupling design: the lack of a corresponding land cover harmonization. For RCP4.5, CESM global afforestation is only 22\% of GCAM's 2005 to 2100 afforestation. Likewise, only 17\% of GCAM's 2040 afforestation, and zero pasture loss, were transmitted to CESM within the directly coupled model. This is a problem because GCAM relied on afforestation to achieve RCP4.5 climate stabilization. GLM modifications and sharing forest area between GCAM and GLM within the directly coupled model did not increase CESM afforestation. Modifying the land use translator in addition to GLM, however, enabled CESM to include 66\% of GCAM's afforestation in 2040, and 94\% of GCAM's pasture loss as grassland and shrubland losses. This additional afforestation increases CESM vegetation carbon gain by 19 PgC and decreases atmospheric CO2 gain by 8 ppmv from 2005 to 2040, which demonstrates that CESM without additional afforestation simulates a different RCP4.5 scenario than prescribed by GCAM. Similar land cover inconsistencies exist in other CMIP5 model results, primarily because land cover information is not shared between models. Further work to harmonize land cover among models will be required to increase fidelity between IAM scenarios and ESM simulations and realize the full potential of scenario-based earth system simulations.},

	abstract = {A new release of the Max Planck Institute for Meteorology Earth System Model version 1.2 (MPI-ESM1.2) is presented. The development focused on correcting errors in and improving the physical processes representation, as well as improving the computational performance, versatility, and overall user friendliness. In addition to new radiation and aerosol parameterizations of the atmosphere, several relatively large, but partly compensating, coding errors in the model's cloud, convection, and turbulence parameterizations were corrected. The representation of land processes was refined by introducing a multilayer soil hydrology scheme, extending the land biogeochemistry to include the nitrogen cycle, replacing the soil and litter decomposition model and improving the representation of wildfires. The ocean biogeochemistry now represents cyanobacteria prognostically in order to capture the response of nitrogen fixation to changing climate conditions and further includes improved detritus settling and numerous other refinements. As something new, in addition to limiting drift and minimizing certain biases, the instrumental record warming was explicitly taken into account during the tuning process. To this end, a very high climate sensitivity of around 7 K caused by low-level clouds in the tropics as found in an intermediate model version was addressed, as it was not deemed possible to match observed warming otherwise. As a result, the model has a climate sensitivity to a doubling of CO2 over preindustrial conditions of 2.77 K, maintaining the previously identified highly nonlinear global mean response to increasing CO2 forcing, which nonetheless can be represented by a simple two-layer model.},

CO2 increases at a rate of 1 \% yr−1
(1pctCO2) from its
preindustrial value are analyzed to quantify the magnitude of
carbon–concentration and carbon–climate feedback parameters which measure
the response of ocean and terrestrial carbon pools to changes in atmospheric
CO2 concentration and the resulting change in global climate,
respectively. The results are based on 11 comprehensive Earth system
models from the most recent (sixth) Coupled Model Intercomparison Project
(CMIP6) and compared with eight models from the fifth CMIP (CMIP5). The
strength of the carbon–concentration feedback is of comparable magnitudes
over land (mean ± standard deviation = 0.97 ± 0.40 PgC ppm−1) and ocean (0.79 ± 0.07 PgC ppm−1), while the
carbon–climate feedback over land (−45.1 ± 50.6 PgC ∘C−1) is about 3 times larger than over ocean (−17.2 ± 5.0 PgC ∘C−1). The strength of both feedbacks is an order of
magnitude more uncertain over land than over ocean as has been seen in
existing studies. These values and their spread from 11 CMIP6 models
have not changed significantly compared to CMIP5 models. The absolute values
of feedback parameters are lower for land with models that include a
representation of nitrogen cycle. The transient climate response to
cumulative emissions (TCRE) from the 11 CMIP6 models considered here is
1.77 ± 0.37 ∘C EgC−1 and is similar to that found in
CMIP5 models (1.63 ± 0.48 ∘C EgC−1) but with somewhat
reduced model spread. The expressions for feedback parameters based on the
fully and biogeochemically coupled configurations of the 1pctCO2 simulation
are simplified when the small temperature change in the
biogeochemically coupled simulation is ignored. Decomposition of the terms
of these simplified expressions for the feedback parameters is used to gain
insight into the reasons for differing responses among ocean and land carbon
cycle models.},

	abstract = {Global forests have the potential to signiﬁcantly increase or reduce atmospheric greenhouse gas (GHG) concentration. Harvested wood products (HWP) are an important part of the forest-atmosphere carbon cycle. On the one hand, HWP can retain the carbon for various periods of time, depending on the end uses. On the other hand, using HWP in place of more GHG-intensive materials and using wood bioenergy to substitute for fossil fuels result in reduced fossil fuel emissions. However, critical methodological diﬀerences exist in existing literature in assessing the GHG eﬀects of HWP and wood bioenergy substitution, and large diversity in system boundary, substitution scenario, study period, and reference baseline results in large diﬀerence in reported GHG eﬀects of wood substitution. In the present study, we conducted a comprehensive literature review to (a) clarify the methodological issues in GHG eﬀects assessments of HWP and wood bioenergy substitution, (b) summarize and compare the reported GHG eﬀects, and (c) identify knowledge gaps to inform future research. We support the conclusion that to accurately assess the GHG eﬀects, HWP and wood bioenergy life-cycle carbon analysis needs to be integrated with forest carbon balance analysis. Substituting HWP for non-wood materials appears to be more eﬀective in reducing GHG emissions than substituting wood for fossil fuels. The time required to obtain net emission reduction for wood bioenergy in place of fossil fuels can be 0 years, decades or more than a century, depending on forest biomass sources (e.g., harvest residue, standing live trees) and fossil fuels displaced. For HWP used to replace non-wood material, however, the time required to obtain net emission reduction largely remains a future research need. Overall, HWP and wood bioenergy originated from sustainably managed forests can signiﬁcantly contribute to GHG emissions reduction in the long term.},

	abstract = {We compare sustainably managed with unmanaged forests in terms of their contribution to climate change mitigation based on published data. For sustainably managed forests, accounting of carbon (C) storage based on ecosystem biomass and products as required by the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change is not sufficient to quantify their contribution to climate change mitigation. The ultimate value of biomass is its use for biomaterials and bioenergy. Taking Germany as an example, we show that the average removals of wood from managed forests are higher than stated by official reports, ranging between 56 and 86 mill. m3 year−1 due to the unrecorded harvest of firewood. We find that removals from one hectare can substitute 0.87 m3 ha−1 year−1 of diesel, or 7.4 MWh ha−1 year−1, taking into account the unrecorded firewood, the use of fuel for harvesting and processing, and the efficiency of energy conversion. Energy substitution ranges between 1.9 and 2.2 t CO2 equiv. ha−1 year−1 depending on the type of fossil fuel production. Including bioenergy and carbon storage, the total mitigation effect of managed forest ranges between 3.2 and 3.5 t CO2 equiv. ha−1 year−1. This is more than previously reported because of the full accounting of bioenergy. Unmanaged nature conservation forests contribute via C storage only about 0.37 t CO2 equiv. ha−1 year−1 to climate change mitigation. There is no fossil fuel substitution. Therefore, taking forests out of management reduces climate change mitigation benefits substantially. There should be a mitigation cost for taking forest out of management in Central Europe. Since the energy sector is rewarded for the climate benefits of bioenergy, and not the forest sector, we propose that a CO2 tax is used to award the contribution of forest management to fossil fuel substitution and climate change mitigation. This would stimulate the production of wood for products and energy substitution.},

	abstract = {Forest biomass can be used in two different ways to limit the growth of the atmospheric greenhouse gas (GHG) concentrations: (1) to provide negative emissions through sequestration of carbon into forests and harvested wood products or (2) to avoid GHG emissions through substitution of non-renewable raw materials with wood. We study the trade-offs and synergies between these strategies using three different Finnish national-level forest scenarios between 2015 and 2044 as examples. We demonstrate how GHG emissions change when wood harvest rates are increased. We take into account CO2 and other greenhouse gas flows in the forest, the decay rate of harvested wood products and fossilbased CO2 emissions that can be avoided by substituting alternative materials with wood derived from increased harvests. We considered uncertainties of key parameters by using stochastic simulation. According to our results, an increase in harvest rates in Finland increased the total net GHG flow to the atmosphere virtually certainly or very likely, given the uncertainties and time frame considered. This was because the increased biomass-based CO2 and other greenhouse gas emissions to the atmosphere together with decreased carbon sequestration into the forest were very likely higher than the avoided fossil-based CO2 emissions. The reverse of this conclusion would require that compared to what was studied in this paper, the share of long-living wood products in the product mix would be higher, carbon dioxide from bioenergy production would be captured and stored, and reduction in forest carbon equivalent net sink due to wood harvesting would be minimized.},

	abstract = {Land-use change affects both the quality and quantity of soil organic carbon (SOC) and leads to changes in ecosystem functions such as productivity and environmental regulation. Future changes in SOC are, however, highly uncertain owing to its heterogeneity and complexity. In this study, we analyzed the outputs of simulations of SOC stock by Earth system models (ESMs), most of which are participants in the Land-Use Model Intercomparison Project. Using a common protocol and the same forcing data, the ESMs simulated SOC distribution patterns and their changes during historical (1850–2014) and future (2015–2100) periods. Total SOC stock increased in many simulations over the historical period (30 ± 67 Pg C) and under future climate and land-use conditions (48 ± 32 Pg C for ssp126 and 49 ± 58 Pg C for ssp370). Land-use experiments indicated that changes in SOC attributable to land-use scenarios were modest at the global scale, in comparison with climatic and rising CO2 impacts, but they were notable in several regions. Future net soil carbon sequestration rates estimated by the ESMs were roughly 0.4‰ yr−1 (0.6 Pg C yr−1). Although there were considerable inter-model differences, the rates are still remarkable in terms of their potential for mitigation of global warming. The disparate results among ESMs imply that key parameters that control processes such as SOC residence time need to be better constrained and that more comprehensive representation of land management impacts on soils remain critical for understanding the long-term potential of soils to sequester carbon.},

These concerns are partly based on an early coupled climate–carbon cycle simulation that produced unusually strong drying and warming in Amazonia. In contrast, the ﬁfth-generation Earth system models (Phase 5 of the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project, CMIP5) produced few examples of Amazon dieback under climate change. Here we examine results from seven sixth-generation models (Phase 6 of the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project, CMIP6), which include interactive vegetation carbon and in some cases interactive forest ﬁres. Although these models typically project increases in area-mean forest carbon across Amazonia under CO2-induced climate change, ﬁve of the seven models also produce abrupt reductions in vegetation carbon, which indicate localised dieback events. The northern South America (NSA) region, which contains most of the rainforest, is especially vulnerable in the models. These dieback events, some of which are mediated by ﬁre, are preceded by an increase in the amplitude of the seasonal cycle in near-surface temperature, which is consistent with more extreme dry seasons. Based on the ensemble mean of the detected dieback events we estimate that 7 ± 5 \% of the NSA region will experience abrupt downward shifts in vegetation carbon for every degree of global warming past 1.5 ◦C.},

Projected fires occur under dry conditions associated with El Niño Southern Oscillation and the Atlantic Multidecadal Oscillation, a response observed under current climate conditions, but exacerbated by an overall decline in precipitation. Following the initial disturbance, grassland dominance promotes recurrent fires and tree competitive exclusion, which prevents forest recovery. EC-Earth3-Veg, an ESM with a dynamic vegetation model of similar complexity, projected comparable wildfire forest loss under high emissions but faster postfire recovery rates. Our results reveal the importance of complex nonlinear responses to assessing climate change impacts and the urgent need to research postfire recovery and its representation in ESMs.},

However the spatial distribution and the extent of both N and P limitation at the global scale have not been quantiﬁed. Here we have developed a global model of carbon (C), nitrogen (N) and phosphorus (P) cycles for the terrestrial biosphere. Model estimates of steady state C and N pool sizes and major ﬂuxes between plant, litter and soil pools, under present climate conditions, agree well with various independent estimates. The total amount of C in the terrestrial biosphere is 2767 Gt C, and the C fractions in plant, litter and soil organic matter are 19\%, 4\% and 77\%. The total amount of N is 135 Gt N, with about 94\% stored in the soil, 5\% in the plant live biomass, and 1\% in litter. We found that the estimates of total soil P and its partitioning into different pools in soil are quite sensitive to biochemical P mineralization. The total amount of P (plant biomass, litter and soil) excluding occluded P in soil is 17 Gt P in the terrestrial biosphere, 33\% of which is stored in the soil organic matter if biochemical P mineralization is modelled, or 31 Gt P with 67\% in soil organic matter otherwise.},

	abstract = {The Canadian Land Surface Scheme “CLASS” was developed in the late 1980s for the Canadian GCM, in response to the perceived need for a “second-generation” land surface model which would adequately treat the effects of vegetation, snow and soil on exchanges of heat and moisture with the atmosphere. CLASS has been tested both in coupled mode with the GCM and in various experiments that have been carried out in conjunction with PILPS, the international Project for Intercomparison of Land-Surface Parameterization Schemes. In the context of those runs, CLASS has been shown to perform quite well. However, it is recognized that a more rigorous framework of testing against field data is required before the model can be used with confidence for studies involving the scaling up of surface fluxes, or the modelling of severely heterogeneous landscapes. The series of papers which follows (to which this one provides an introductory overview) describes the testing of CLASS against a wide variety of micrometeorological datasets, and the model development that has proceeded alongside this work, under the auspices of the Canadian Climate Research Network, from 1994 to 1997. The highlights of this research include the development of new algorithms for bare soil evaporation; forest transpiration; heat and moisture transfers in organic soils; and regional-scale river routing.},

	abstract = {Leaf phenology remains one of the most difﬁcult processes to parameterize in terrestrial ecosystem models because our understanding of the physical processes that initiate leaf onset and senescence is incomplete. While progress has been made at the molecular level, for example by identifying genes that are associated with senescence and ﬂowering for selected plant species, a picture of the processes controlling leaf phenology is only beginning to emerge. A variety of empirical formulations have been used with varying degrees of success in terrestrial ecosystem models for both extratropical and tropical biomes. For instance, the use of growing degree-days (GDDs) to initiate leaf onset has received considerable recognition and this approach is used in a number of models. There are, however, limitations when using GDDs and other empirically based formulations in global transient climate change simulations.},

The quality of the simulation in AMIP (Atmospheric Model Intercomparison Project) mode has been provided in Part 1. Part 2 provides documentation of key components and some sensitivities to choices of model formulation and values of parameters, highlighting the convection parameterization and orographic gravity wave drag. The approach taken to tune the model’s clouds to observations is a particular focal point. Care is taken to describe the extent to which aerosol effective forcing and Cess sensitivity have been tuned through the model development process, both of which are relevant to the ability of the model to simulate the evolution of temperatures over the last century when coupled to an ocean model.},

	abstract = {Carbon and water cycles are intimately coupled in terrestrial ecosystems, and water-use efﬁciency (WUE; carbon gain at the expense of unit water loss) is one of the key parameters of ecohydrology and ecosystem management. In this study, the carbon cycle and water budget of terrestrial ecosystems were simulated using a process-based ecosystem model called Vegetation Integrative Simulator for Trace Gases (VISIT), and WUE was evaluated: WUEC, deﬁned as gross primary production (GPP) divided by transpiration; and WUES, deﬁned as net primary production (NPP) divided by actual evapotranspiration. Total annual WUEC and WUES of the terrestrial biosphere were estimated as 8.0 and 0.92 g C kg21 H2O, respectively, for the period 1995–2004. Spatially, WUEC and WUES were only weakly correlated. WUES ranged from ,0.2 g C kg21 H2O in arid ecosystems to .1.5 g C kg21 H2O in boreal and alpine ecosystems. The historical simulation implied that biospheric WUE increased from 1901 to 2005 (WUEC, 17\%; WUES, 112\%) mainly as a result of the augmentation of productivity in parallel with the atmospheric carbon dioxide increase. Country-based analyses indicated that total NPP is largely determined by water availability, and human appropriation of NPP is also related to water resources to a considerable extent. These results have implications for 1) responses of the carbon cycle to the anticipated global hydrological changes, 2) responses of the water budget to changes in the terrestrial carbon cycle, and 3) ecosystem management based on optimized resource use.},

The JULES model has been coupled to the Met Ofﬁce Uniﬁed Model (UM) and as such provides a unique opportunity for the research community to contribute their research to improve both worldleading operational weather forecasting and climate change prediction systems. In addition JULES, and its forerunner MOSES, have been the basis for a number of very highproﬁle papers concerning the land-surface and climate over the last decade. JULES has a modular structure aligned to physical processes, providing the basis for a ﬂexible modelling platform.},
